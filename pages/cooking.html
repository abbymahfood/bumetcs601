            On this page you'll find recipes I've tried! You'll see that I love
            cooking and baking. I often use my air-fryer, stand-mixer, and
            pressure cooker to experiment with. My partner is a diabetic so
            we're always trying to find new and healthier ways to create
            delicious food!

                    I was inspired to make this recipe when a co-worker said she
                    had tried it and enjoyed it. I also enjoy anything with puff
                    pastry and butter.

                  <li>
                    This recipe was a little complicated but tasted alright in
                    the end. I think the puff pastry may have been too thin.

                    This recipe was delicious! But I had a lot of help from
                    other people at The Gathering Table.

                    We also prepared a really good Thai Chicken Soup. There was
                    a lot of waiting around while food cooked but otherwise the
                    experience was enjoyable.

                    I made this cake for my partner's birthday. He likes golf so
                    I made it golf-themed.

                    This actually tasted pretty terrible and I wouldn't bake it
                    again.
