                    <h3 id="top">Hello from my Pets!</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have adopted four animals! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first was Patch. He is a black cat who I adopted when he was one year old.
                        He loves to cuddle and explore. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next to join the family was Sammy. He was about seven years old when
                        he was adopted. He loves to gather toys and cuddle with them. 
                        He takes breakfast and dinner very seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next up was Nea. She was adopted by my partner as a puppy and 
                        I've had the joy of adopting her as well. She
                        loves to catch a ball and rip up toys much to Sammy's dismay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly is Winston. He was adopted as a kitten
                        and is more cautious than Patch. He loves finding places to nap and is 
                        first up when it comes to feeding time. 
                    </p>
