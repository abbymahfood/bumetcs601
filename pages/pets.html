            <h3>Hello from my Pets!</h3>
            <p>
                I have adopted four animals! The first was Patch. He is a black cat who I adopted when he was 1 year old.
                He loves to cuddle and explore. The next to join the family was Sammy. He was about 7 years old when
                he was adopted. He loves to gather toys and cuddle with them. He takes breakfast and dinner very seriously.
                Next up was Nea. She was adopted by my partner as a puppy and I've had the joy of adopting her as well. She
                loves to catch a ball and rip up toys much to Sammy's dismay. Lastly is Winston. He was adopted as a kitten
                and is more cautious than Patch. He loves finding places to nap and is first up when it comes to feeding time.
