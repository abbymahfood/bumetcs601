            <p>
                Hello! My name is Abby Mahfood and this webpage is for BU MET CS601. I grew up in central Florida and 
                received by Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science Engineering from the University of Florida (Go Gators!). 
                After graduating, I started working full time as a Software Engineer for 
                <a href="https://www.l3harris.com/">L3 Harris Technologies</a>. After six years of software development including 
                embedded software applications, console applications, and ASP.NET Core web applications, I decided it was time for 
                a change of pace. I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer for <a href="https://capitalone.com">Capital One</a>.
                At Capital One, I work mostly with node.js and Amazon Web Services. I am currently pursing my Master's Degree in 
                Software Development from <a href="https://www.bu.edu/met/degrees-certificates/ms-software-development/">Boston University's Metropolitan College</a>.
                I have a few hobbies including exercising, cooking/baking, playing video games, reading, and taking care of my pets. 
                I also enjoy traveling and have had the opportunity to travel to Colorado, New York, and Georgia this year. 
                Below is a picture of me enjoying iced coffee in Savannah, Georgia and a video of me kayaking in upstate New York!
