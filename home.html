          <p>Hello!</p>
          <p>My name is Abby Mahfood and this webpage is for BUMET CS601.</p>
          <p>
            I grew up in central Florida and received my Bachelor's of Science
            in Computer Science Engineering from the University of Florida. Go
            Gators!
          </p>

          <p>
            After graduating, I started working full time as a Software Engineer
            for
            <a href="https://www.l3harris.com/">L3 Harris Technologies</a>. I
            had the opportunity to work on embedded software applications,
            console applications, and ASP.NET Core web applications. After six
            years, I decided it was time for a change of pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer for
            <a href="https://capitalone.com">Capital One</a>. I work mostly with
            node.js and Amazon Web Services. I am also pursing my Master's
            Degree in Software Development from
            <a
              href="https://www.bu.edu/met/degrees-certificates/ms-software-development/"
            >
              Boston University's Metropolitan College </a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hobbies include exercising, cooking/baking, playing video games,
            reading, and taking care of my pets. I enjoy traveling and have had
            the opportunity to travel to Colorado, New York, and Georgia this
            year. On this page you'll find a picture of me enjoying iced coffee
            in Savannah, Georgia and a video of me kayaking in upstate New York!
